User information

To *use* the software the recommended way is to use the SL installer
which automatically downloads and deploys all the tools from
pre-packaged archives. 

More information here: https://notes.svp-home.org/sl13.html

The installer can be downloaded from here: http://dist.svp-home.org/dev/

The source archives can be downloaded individually here: http://dist.svp-home.org/deploy/
